# The-Bit-Blocks

The game won us the third prize in the DPEC competition. A single-player game that makes use of a joystick and FPGA, where the player makes sure that the blocks drop in place. Unlike the normal Tetris game, our game consists of a bucket that needs to be filled by the blocks falling from the top of the screen once the bucket is filled above a certain threshold, the game ends!
